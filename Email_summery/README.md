## Model Description
This application uses:

Model: gemini-2.5-flash via LangChain's ChatGoogleGenerativeAI

Purpose: To summarize email bodies and subjects in 1â€“2 lines.

Behavior:

For the parent email, a direct summary is generated.

For follow-up emails, the model is given previous summaries for context.

The summaries are stored thread-wise using an in-memory dictionary.





## Flow
User sends a POST request to /email/summarize with a list of emails in a thread.

The app processes each email:

If it's a parent email, it generates a summary directly.

If it's a child, it prepends earlier summaries for contextual summarization.

The response contains a list of thread-wise summaries.
Ex : email1 ---> s1
    email2 ----> s1 + email2(body) ---> s2
    email3 ----> s1 + s2 + email3(body) ---> s3
